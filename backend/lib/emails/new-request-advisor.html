			<p class="title">Hello "{{ clubName }}" advisor,</p>
			<br>
			<p>You were just listed as an advisor for an activity request submitted to Mountain View High School ASB.</p>
			<br>
			<p>"{{ studentName }}" listed you as the advisor for "{{ activityName }}"</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-weight: bold;">A couple things you need to know:</p>
			<p style="max-width: 1000px;">
				1. Every single activity request has its own
				<span style="font-style: italic;">ID</span>. The ID for the this request is:<br><br>
				<span style="background: rgb(221, 221, 221); padding: 6px 10px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block;">{{ id
					}}</span><br><br>
				It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">extremely</span> important that you hold on to this ID. You can
				use this ID to track your request and view details at our website.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p style="max-width: 1000px;">2. <span style="font-weight: bold; background: #fccb0b;">Your activity is not yet approved.</span>
				It needs to be approved by the necessary parties associated with the locations your event utilizes.
				After that occurs, ASB has to then approve your activity. Learn how to get your activity approved by
				visiting the "help" section of our website.<br>
				It is your repsonsiblity to contact the necessary parties/departments and ask them to approve your activity request.
